## _#_**1** Some of the problem are listed below.

Some of the problems that I could notice in the given Data sets are mentioned below.

1. Time Data column is missing hence, we cannot make out what time the data was recoreded.
2. Data is not recored everyday, its been recored on random days. Scientist goal is to record data for an year and compare and when they dont record it everyday then the result obtained after comparision is not valid.
