## _#_**1** Problems are listed below.

Some of the problems that I could notice in the given Data sets are mentioned below.

1. Time Data column is missing hence; we cannot make out what time the data was recorded.
2. Data is not recorded every day; it’s been recorded on random days. Scientist goal is to record data for a year and compare all the recorded data throughout the years and when they don’t record it every day then the result obtained after comparison is not valid.
3. Few data in the sheet are missing like TEMP(ZOO.csv), Density(Pond.csv), Colony Diameter(Pond.csv), TEMP(Pond.csv).
4. Few values in the data sheets are predicted values. Since the record is in red, I assume that those values are predicted.
5. Column name in Pond is "Z" instead of "Depth".
6. Pond sheet is missing counts per liter of each species.
7. The place from where the samples are taken is not mentioned.
8. Based on my study over Planktons, a lot of factors affect the growth of the organism like water condition, the intensity of light and min-max temperature of the water on a given day, all these data are missing in the current record.
 
 
 ## _#_ **2** Potential Template for New System Organization
 
 When I went through wikipage about Planktons, I read factors like water condition, light of intensity and PH level of the water places an important role in the growth of Planktons. So I would like to consider these data to recored as it would help scientist to get better result.
