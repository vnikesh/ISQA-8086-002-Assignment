## _#_**1** Problems are listed below.

Some of the problems that I could notice in the given Data sets are mentioned below.

1. Time Data column is missing hence; we cannot make out what time the data was recorded.
2. Data is not recorded every day; it’s been recorded on random days. Scientist goal is to record data for a year and compare all the recorded data throughout the years and when they don’t record it every day then the result obtained after comparison is not valid.
3. Few data in the sheet are missing like TEMP(ZOO.csv), Density(Pond.csv), Colony Diameter(Pond.csv), TEMP(Pond.csv).
4. Few values in the data sheets are predicted values. As few values are in red, I assume that those values are predicted.
5. Column name in Pond is "Z" instead of "Depth".
6. Pond sheet is missing counts per liter of each species(both Cuni and Chippo).
7. The place from where the samples are taken is not mentioned. It is important to make a note of the place from where the same are been taken.
8. Based on my study over Planktons, a lot of factors affect the growth of the organism like water condition, the intensity of light and min-max temperature of the water on a given day, all these data are missing in the current record.
 
 
 ## _#_ **2** Potential Template for New System Organization
 
 When I went through wiki page about Planktons, I read factors like water condition, the light of intensity and PH level of the water places an important role in the growth of Planktons. So I would like to consider these data to be recorded as it would help the scientist to get a better result.
 
 As the data is recorded during day and night, a column with Time is required.
 
| Date | Time | Depth | Min Temp of Water | Max Temp of Water | Temp during recording | Cuni#/L | Cuni Colony Size | Chippo #/L | Chippo Colony Size | Chla | Place | Physical Ocean Condition | Dissolved Carbon Dioxide | Light Intensity | pH level of water |
|------|------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------|------------------|------------|--------------------|------|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
