The Dataset had over 18 columns and around 100 rows

### Access & Use Information
*License:* No license information was provided, the dataset can be used by public to solve the problems.

The dataset is provided by McDonalds to check the nutrition level in each meal.

### Questions this data might help to answer

1. How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contains?
2. How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake?
3. What is the least number of items could you order from the menu to meet one day's nutritional requirements?

#### Observation:

I felt this data would be interesting to start off with small project, there wont be too much burden in solving the questions, hence I have included this dataset.

*Dataset* - I have uploaded the dataset(__menu.csv__) to the repository.
